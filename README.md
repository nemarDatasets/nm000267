  Primary modality: visual

  Instructions: Subjects were instructed to perform kinesthetic MI (i.e., to imagine the opening and closing their hands as they were grabbing a ball) to ensure that actual MI, not visual MI, was performed. Subjects were asked to imagine hand gripping (opening and closing their hands) with a 1 Hz pace.

Abstract
--------
We provide an open access dataset for hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). For this, we conducted two BCI experiments (left versus right hand motor imagery; mental arithmetic versus resting state). The dataset was validated using baseline signal analysis methods, with which classification performance was evaluated for each modality and a combination of both modalities. As already shown in previous literature, the capability of discriminating different mental states can be enhanced by using a hybrid approach, when comparing to single modality analyses. This makes the provided data highly suitable for hybrid BCI investigations. Since our open access dataset also comprises motion artifacts and physiological data, we expect that it can be used in a wide range of future validation approaches in multimodal BCI research.

Methodology
-----------
Twenty-nine right-handed and one left-handed healthy subjects participated in motor imagery and mental arithmetic tasks. EEG data was recorded at 1000 Hz using 30 active electrodes with a BrainAmp amplifier, referenced to linked mastoids. NIRS data was collected at 12.5 Hz using NIRScout with 14 sources and 16 detectors resulting in 36 channels. Three sessions were conducted for each paradigm (MI and MA). Each session included 20 trials with 10s task periods and 15-17s rest periods. For MI, subjects performed kinesthetic hand gripping imagery at 1 Hz pace. Visual instructions included arrows for MI and arithmetic problems for MA. Motion artifacts from eye/head movements were also recorded. Signal processing included CSP for spatial filtering, log-variance features, and shrinkage LDA classifier with 10x5-fold cross-validation.
